Description
    The start of a multi-stage project in modern and practical application development
    building a website using both the front-end and back-end code, to deploy on a cloud platform
    I chose something im interested in to keep working on the project and learn about using data

Writing to a Web API
Create Model objects including
    - data layer
    - controller layer
    - routing layer

Routing
    The web server should contain two end points for each kind of object. Different actions can be performed on an endpoint using the RESTful HTTP verbs - GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE.
Robust Endpoints
    When defining endpoints keep in mind any errors that may occur an properlly handel them, this inclues returning the proper HTTP status codes

Testing/documentation
    For testing use postman to save requests to a collection, this will be used with documentation
